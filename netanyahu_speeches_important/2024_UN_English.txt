Address to the UN General Assembly (September 27, 2024) - Benjamin Netanyahu

(Transcript based on available reports and summaries)

"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war, fighting for its life. But after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight. I decided to come here to speak for my people. To speak for my country, to speak for the truth.

And here is the truth: Israel seeks peace. Israel yearns for peace. Israel has made peace and will make peace again. Yet we face savage enemies who seek our annihilation, and we must defend ourselves against them. These savage murderers, our enemies, seek not only to destroy us, they seek to destroy our common civilization and return all of us to a dark age of tyranny and terror.

...

The curse of October 7th began when Hamas invaded Israel from Gaza. But it didn't end there. Israel was soon forced to defend itself on six more war fronts organized by Iran. On October 8th, Hezbollah attacked us from Lebanon. Since then, they have fired over 8,000 rockets at our towns and cities, at our civilians, at our children. Two weeks later, the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen launched drones and missiles at Israel, the first of 250 such attacks...

I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran: If you strike us, we will strike you. There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East. Far from being lambs to the slaughter, Israel's soldiers have fought back with incredible courage...

We have another major war goal: To return our hostages... I want to assure you, we will not rest until the remaining hostages are brought home...

Regarding Hezbollah: Enough is enough. We won't rest until our citizens can return safely to their homes. We will not accept a terror army perched on our northern border, able to perpetrate another October 7th-style massacre...

Regarding Gaza: This war can end now. All that has to happen is for Hamas to surrender, lay down its arms and release all the hostages. But if they don't – we will fight until we achieve total victory. Total victory. There is no substitute for it.
