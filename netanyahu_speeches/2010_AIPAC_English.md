(Excerpt reconstruction based on key themes)

My friends,

Jerusalem is not a settlement. It is our capital.

The Jewish people were building Jerusalem 3,000 years ago, and the Jewish people are building Jerusalem today. Jerusalem is not a settlement. It is our capital.

We want peace. But peace must be based on truth. And the truth is that the root of the conflict is not the settlements, but the refusal of the Palestinians to recognize the Jewish state.

We face a great challenge. The challenge of a nuclear-armed Iran. A nuclear-armed Iran would be a threat not only to Israel, but to the entire world. It would embolden terrorists, destabilize the region, and threaten the oil supply of the world.

We must stop Iran. And we must stand together. Israel and America stand together.

Thank you.
