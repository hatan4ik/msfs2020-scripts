Citizens of Israel, Holocaust Survivors, Families of the Hostages,

"Never Again" is now.

Eighty years ago, in the Holocaust, the Jewish people were totally defenseless against those who sought our destruction. No nation came to our aid. We had no voice, we had no protection. Our cries were not heard, our torment ignored.

Today, we again face enemies bent on our destruction. But today is different. Today, we have a state. We have an army. We have the power to defend ourselves.

If Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone. And we will continue to smite our enemies until we achieve victory. Even if we must stand alone, we will continue fighting human evil.

No pressure and no resolutions from any international forum will prevent us from defending ourselves. The State of Israel will not kowtow to the murderers and instigators of antisemitism.

We remember our fallen heroes. Heroes like Major Moshe Yedidyah Leiter, who went to battle with the legacy of the Holocaust on his shoulders. He carried the burden of responsibility.

To our enemies I say: You will not succeed. The spirit of the Jewish people is unbreakable.

Am Yisrael Chai.
