Citizens of Israel,

I stand before you tonight with a sense of deep responsibility and profound gratitude. The people of Israel have spoken. They have chosen a new path, a path of security and peace.

My first and foremost task as Prime Minister is to mend the rifts, to reduce the tensions, and to strengthen the unity and the sense of partnership within our society. Peace begins at home. I intend to be the Prime Minister of all Israeli citizens – Jews, Arabs, Druze, Circassians, Bedouin – all of us are citizens of one state, all of us have one destiny.

We are brothers. We have disagreements, but we are one people. I call upon everyone, from all parts of the political spectrum, to join hands. Let us put the elections behind us and work together for the sake of our common future.

To our neighbors, I say: We want peace. We want a stable peace, a real peace, peace with security. I extend my hand in peace to all Arab leaders. Join us in advancing a dialogue that will bring security and prosperity to all the peoples of our region. But let it be clear: This peace will be based on security. It will not be a peace of weakness, but a peace of strength.

Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people, will remain united under Israeli sovereignty. It will never again be divided. This is our rock, our heritage, and our future.

I want to say a word about Shimon Peres. Mr. Peres has dedicated his life to the State of Israel. His contribution to our security and our standing in the world spans fifty years. I have great respect for him, and I call upon you to show him the respect he deserves.

We have a great task ahead of us. We will build a free economy, an economy of opportunity for every citizen. We will unleash the potential of our people. We will strengthen the foundations of our democracy.

Thank you, citizens of Israel, for your trust. I will work day and night to justify this trust, to lead Israel to safety, to peace, and to a better future for our children.

Am Yisrael Chai!
