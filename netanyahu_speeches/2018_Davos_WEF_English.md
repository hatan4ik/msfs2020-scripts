(Summary of remarks and conversation with Fareed Zakaria)

Israel is a light unto the nations. We are experiencing a revolution. We are a global power in technology, in cyber, in water, in agriculture.

Cars are computers on wheels. And Israel has a car industry. We are driving the future of transportation with autonomous vehicles and big data.

Regarding the Iran deal: It is deeply flawed. It gives Iran a highway to the bomb. The inspections are a joke; they can't inspect military sites. We need to fix it or nix it.

I want to thank President Trump for his historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This decision pushes peace forward because peace can only be built on truth. The UN is a house of slander. But America's support is rock-solid.

We are building a future of innovation and strength.
