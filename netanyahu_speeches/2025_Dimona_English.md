# Remarks at Government Meeting in Dimona
**Date:** December 14, 2025
**Location:** Dimona, Israel

Citizens of Israel,

We are meeting today in Dimona. I want to address two critical issues.

First, the rising tide of antisemitism. I sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Australia four months ago. I warned him: calling for a Palestinian state now pours fuel on the antisemitic fire. It rewards Hamas. It emboldens those who menace Jews.

We see the results. The horrific attacks we have seen are a direct consequence of this weakness. Antisemitism is a cancer. It must be fought. We expect Western governments to show action and strength. Israel will not be silent. We expect you to fight those who attack the West and the Jewish people.

Second, on our security. Today, I can announce that the IDF has eliminated Raad Saad. He was an arch-terrorist. He was one of the architects of the October 7 massacre. He built the "Jericho Wall" plan. He was the one re-arming Hamas.

Let this be clear: Our policy is zero tolerance. We do not tolerate violations of the ceasefire. Anyone who tries to organize terrorism against us is in our crosshairs.

We will hunt them. We will find them. And we will ruthlessly dispose of them. Whether in Gaza, in Lebanon, or anywhere else. We will not sit by and let these killers kill us.

We are also continuing our efforts to return Ran Gvili. We leave no one behind.

We are strong. We are determined. And we will continue to defend our state.
