# Address to the AIPAC Policy Conference
**Date:** March 2, 2015

My friends,

I bring you greetings from Jerusalem, the eternal, undivided capital of Israel and the Jewish people.

I know there has been some talk lately about the relationship between Israel and the United States. Let me be clear: Reports of the demise of Israeli-U.S. relations are not only premature, they're just wrong. America and Israel are more than friends. We're like a family. Families have disagreements, but they remain family.

I am going to Congress tomorrow to speak up for my country. I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of a danger that threatens our very survival.

We agree that Iran should not have nuclear weapons. But we disagree on the best way to prevent them from developing those weapons. The deal being negotiated now is a bad deal. It paves Iran's path to the bomb.

Today, we are no longer silent. Today, we have a voice. And tomorrow, as Prime Minister of the one and only Jewish state, I plan to use that voice.

Israel is a beacon of humanity, of light, and of hope in a dark, savage, and desperate Middle East. We defend ourselves. We defend our values. And we stand with our friends.

Stand tall, stand strong, stand proud! America and Israel stand for life!

Thank you.
