Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress,

I stand before you today as the Prime Minister of Israel, a nation that shares a profound bond with the United States of America. We have a common vision of how societies should be governed, of how civilization should be advanced. We both believe in eternal values, we both believe in the Almighty. We both follow traditions hallowed by time and experience.

America's moral force is derived from the Bible and the precepts of morality that the Jewish people have given the world. And I want to thank the American people for their succor and support to the fledgling Jewish state, and for standing by Israel against the forces of tyranny and totalitarianism.

I believe the terrorists must understand that we will not yield, however grave and fearful the challenge. Neither Israel nor any other democracy, and certainly not the United States, must ever bend to terrorism. We must fight it resolutely, endlessly, tirelessly. We must fight it together, until we remove this malignancy from the face of the earth.

There has been a double standard applied to the Middle East. Violence and despotism have been excused and not challenged. It is time for the states of the Middle East to put the issues of human rights and democratization on their agenda. Democratization means accepting a free press and the right of a legal opposition to organize and express itself.

We face dangers from regimes like Iran and Iraq, particularly if they were to acquire nuclear weapons. We must isolate these regimes and prevent them from acquiring atomic power. This is a threat not just to Israel, but to the entire world.

Israel is ready for peace. We are ready to engage in negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, aiming to broaden the circle of peace to the whole Arab world and the rest of the countries of the Middle East. But we will not uproot anyone, nor shall we be uprooted. We shall insist on the right of Jews to live anywhere in the Land of Israel.

We are not asking for American troops to defend us. We defend ourselves. We appreciate the tools you give us, but the job of defense is ours. We are a self-reliant nation.

Thank you, America, for being our partner and our friend.
