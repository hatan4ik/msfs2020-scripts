Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress,

I come here to speak about the unbreakable bond between our two nations. Israel has no better friend than America, and America has no better friend than Israel.

We stand together to defend democracy. We stand together to advance peace. We stand together to fight terrorism. And on this note, I want to congratulate the United States of America for bringing justice to Osama bin Laden. Good riddance!

In a Middle East that is shifting and shaking, Israel is the one anchor of stability. Israel is America's unwavering ally. Israel is not what is wrong about the Middle East; Israel is what is right about the Middle East.

We do not need nation-building. We are already built. We do not need you to export democracy to us. We've already got it. We defend ourselves.

I am willing to make painful compromises to achieve this historic peace. As the leader of Israel, it is my responsibility to lead my people to peace. This is not easy for me. I recognize that in a genuine peace, we will be required to give up parts of the ancestral Jewish homeland. And you have to understand this: In Judea and Samaria, the Jewish people are not foreign occupiers. We are not the British in India. We are not the Belgians in the Congo. This is the land of our forefathers, the Land of Israel, to which Abraham brought the message of one God, where David set out to confront Goliath, and where Isaiah saw a vision of eternal peace.

No distortion of history can deny the four thousand year old bond between the Jewish people and the Jewish land.

But there is another truth: The Palestinians share this small land with us. We seek a peace in which they will have their own state, but not one that threatens our existence. I accept a Palestinian state. But it must be a demilitarized state that recognizes the Jewish state.

President Abbas, I say to you: Tear up your pact with Hamas! Sit down and negotiate! Make peace with the Jewish state. If you do, those six words will change history: "I accept the Jewish State."

The greatest danger facing our world is the meeting of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. We must not let that happen. History will not forgive those who allow this to happen.

Thank you.
