Declaration of War / Operation Swords of Iron (October 7, 2023) - Benjamin Netanyahu
Statement from the Kirya, Tel Aviv

"Citizens of Israel,
We are at war. Not in an operation, not in rounds of fighting – at war.

This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens. We have been in this since the early morning hours.
I convened the heads of the security establishment and ordered – first of all – to cleanse the communities that have been infiltrated by terrorists. This is currently being carried out.

At the same time, I have ordered an extensive mobilization of reserves and that we return fire of a magnitude that the enemy has not known. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price.
In the meantime, I call on the citizens of Israel to strictly adhere to the directives of the IDF and Home Front Command. We are at war and we will win it.

[Later statement on the same day]

Hamas invaded Israeli territory and murdered innocent citizens including children and the elderly. Hamas has started a brutal and evil war. We will be victorious in this war despite an unbearable price.
What happened today has never been seen in Israel, and I will ensure it does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision. The IDF will use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We will strike them to the bitter end and avenge with force this dark day they have brought on Israel and its people.

I say to the residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere.

We are all praying for the well-being of the wounded and all those who are being held hostage. I say to Hamas: You are responsible for their well-being. Israel will settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads.

To the residents of the south – we all stand with you.
I salute the soldiers of the IDF, the police officers, and the security forces. You are the continuation of the heroes of the Jewish people: Joshua, Judah Maccabee, and the heroes of 1948, 1967, and 1973.

We face difficult days ahead. But I promise you: With the help of God, the forces we have combined, and our faith in the righteousness of our path – we will win."
