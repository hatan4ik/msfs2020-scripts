# Address to the AIPAC Policy Conference
**Date:** March 5, 2012
**Location:** Washington, D.C.
**Context:** The "Duck" Speech regarding Iran's nuclear program.

---

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I have come here today to speak about a subject that threatens us all: a nuclear-armed Iran.

For fifteen years, I have been warning about this threat. The world has tried diplomacy. It hasn't worked. The world has tried sanctions. They haven't worked. Iran's nuclear program continues to march forward.

Some say that stopping Iran is too dangerous. I say that a nuclear-armed Iran is far more dangerous.

We have heard this before. In 1944, the World Jewish Congress pleaded with the American government to bomb Auschwitz. The answer was no. They said it would divert air support. They said it might provoke "even more vindictive action by the Germans."

Think about that. "Even more vindictive action." Against a people who were being gassed and burned by the millions.

I am here to tell you: As Prime Minister of Israel, I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation.

If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then what is it? That's right, it's a duck. But this duck is a nuclear duck. And it's time the world started calling a duck a duck.

A nuclear-armed Iran would provide a nuclear umbrella to terrorists. It could choke off the world's oil supply. It could threaten nuclear terrorism.

In every generation, there are those who rise up to destroy us. But in this generation, we have something they didn't have then. We have the State of Israel. And the State of Israel will defend itself.

Thank you, AIPAC, for standing with us.
