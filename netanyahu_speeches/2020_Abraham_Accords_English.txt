Abraham Accords Signing Ceremony (September 15, 2020) - Benjamin Netanyahu
White House South Lawn

"Ladies and gentlemen,
I have devoted my life to securing Israel's place among the nations to ensure the future of the one and only Jewish State. To accomplish that goal, I work to make Israel strong, very strong, for history has taught us that strength brings security, strength brings allies, and ultimately -- and this is something President Trump has said again and again -- ultimately, strength brings peace.

I am grateful to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, of the United Arab Emirates, and to you, Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. I thank you both for your wise leadership and for working with the United States and Israel to expand the circle of peace.

I am grateful to King Hamad of Bahrain, and to you, Foreign Minister Abdullatif Al Zayani, for joining us -- joining us in bringing hope to all the children of Abraham!

To all of Israel's friends in the Middle East, those who are with us today and those who will join us tomorrow, I say: As-salamu alaykum. Peace unto thee. Shalom!

This day is a pivot of history. It heralds a new dawn of peace. For thousands of years, the Jewish people have prayed for peace. For decades, the Jewish State has prayed for peace. And this is why, today, we're filled with such profound gratitude.

This peace will eventually expand to include other Arab states. And ultimately, it can end the Arab-Israeli conflict once and for all.

To those who are with us today, and to those who will join us tomorrow, I say:
Salaam Alaikum.
Shalom."
