Mr. President, Donald Trump,

Welcome back to Jerusalem. Welcome back to the eternal capital of the Jewish people.

Today is a momentous day. A day of great joy mixed with deep sorrow. Great joy, because our hostages are coming home. All of them. The proposal you backed, Mr. President, brings them home.

And today, the war ends. We have achieved our objectives.

I want to thank you, President Trump. You are the greatest friend that the State of Israel has ever had in the White House. No American president has ever done more for Israel. And it's not even close. Your pivotal leadership made this day possible.

We remember October 7th. The barbaric attack. The pain. The loss. But Israel did what it had to do. With indomitable courage, we set out to defend our people, to defeat our enemies, and to release our hostages.

Our enemies now understand just how powerful and just how determined Israel is. Israel is strong. Israel is here to stay.

We have achieved amazing victories. Hamas is defeated. The Iran terror axis is broken. Sinwar, Deif, Haniyeh, Nasrallah – they are all gone. Iran's nuclear program has been rolled back, thanks to your enormous help.

The last two years have been a time of war. The coming years will hopefully be a time for peace. This, Mr. President, is peace through strength. We look forward to forging new peace treaties with our Arab and Muslim neighbors, expanding the historic Abraham Accords.

We bow our heads in memory of our fallen heroes. 1,200 slaughtered on that black Saturday. Thousands of brave soldiers who fell or were wounded defending our home. Because of them, we survive. Because of them, we will thrive.

Thank you, Mr. President. God bless Israel, and God bless America.
