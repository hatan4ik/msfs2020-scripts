Address to the U.S. Congress (March 3, 2015) - Benjamin Netanyahu

"Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Madam Leader, Mr. Pro Tempore, honorable members of Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

I'm deeply humbled by the opportunity to speak for a third time before the most important legislative body in the world, the U.S. Congress. I want to thank you all for being here today. I know that my speech has been the subject of much controversy. I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political. That was never my intention. I want to thank you, Democrats and Republicans, for your common support for Israel, year after year, decade after decade.

I know that no matter on which side of the aisle you sit, you stand with Israel. America and Israel, we're more than allies, we're family. And Israel is grateful to you, the American Congress, for your support, for supporting us in so many ways, especially in generous military assistance and missile defense, including Iron Dome. Last summer, millions of Israelis were protected from thousands of Hamas rockets because this capital dome helped build our Iron Dome. Thank you, America. Thank you for everything you've done for Israel.

My friends, I've come here today because, as prime minister of Israel, I feel a profound obligation to speak to you about an issue that could well threaten the survival of my country and the future of my people: Iran's quest for nuclear weapons. We're an ancient people. In our nearly 4,000 years of history, many have tried repeatedly to destroy the Jewish people. Tomorrow, the Jewish people will celebrate Purim. We'll read the Book of Esther. We'll read about a powerful Persian viceroy named Haman, who plotted to destroy the Jewish people some 2,500 years ago. He failed. The Jewish people were saved.

Today, the Jewish people face another Persian potentate, whose regime is hell-bent on destroying Israel. This time, the Jewish people are not alone. We have the support of the greatest nation in the world, the United States of America.

The greatest dangers facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. To defeat ISIS and let Iran get nuclear weapons would be to win the battle, but lose the war. We can't let that happen. But that, my friends, is exactly what could happen, if the deal now being negotiated is accepted by Iran. That deal will not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, lots of them. Let me explain why.

The current deal on the table would not block Iran's path to the bomb, it would pave it. This deal would not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. It would legitimize Iran's nuclear program and make it a threshold nuclear state.

Ladies and gentlemen, I've come here today to tell you we don't have to bet the security of the world on the hope that Iran will change for the better. We don't have to gamble with our future and with our children's future. We can insist that restrictions on Iran's nuclear program not be lifted for as long as Iran continues its aggression in the region and in the world. Before lifting those restrictions, the world should demand that Iran do three things. First, stop its aggression against its neighbors in the Middle East. Second, stop supporting terrorism around the world. And third, stop threatening to annihilate my country, Israel, the one and only Jewish state.

If Iran's aggression is not stopped, it will be a matter of time before it threatens the entire world. We must all stand together to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.

Thank you, God bless America, and God bless Israel."
