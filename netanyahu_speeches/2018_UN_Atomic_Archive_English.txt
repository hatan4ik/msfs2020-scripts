Address to the UN General Assembly (September 27, 2018) - Benjamin Netanyahu
"The Atomic Archive Speech"

[Excerpts focusing on the key revelations]

...
In May, Israel exposed the world to Iran's secret nuclear archive. We obtained 100,000 documents and videos from a secret vault in Tehran. We shared this vast treasure trove of information with the United States, with the IAEA, and with other countries.
What I'm about to say has not been shared publicly before.
Today, I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran. A secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran's secret nuclear weapons program.

You see, Iran didn't abandon its goal to develop nuclear weapons. No. It just moved the program underground.
This site contained as much as 300 tons – 300 tons! – of nuclear-related equipment and material.

...
Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction to develop nuclear weapons. Not now, not in ten years, not ever.
We will act against you in Syria. We will act against you in Lebanon. We will act against you in Iraq. We will act against you wherever and whenever we must act to defend our state and defend our people.

...
I have a message for the tyrants of Tehran: Israel knows what you're doing, and Israel knows where you're doing it.
I have a message for the people of Iran: You are not our enemy. You are our friends.

[Addressing the UN and the Palestinians]
We won't solve our conflict with libelous speeches at the UN. We won't solve it with unilateral decisions... We have to sit together and negotiate together.

Israel is a Jewish and democratic state. It is the nation-state of the Jewish people, where we respect the rights of all our citizens – Jews and non-Jews alike.
But make no mistake: Israel is the Jewish state, and it will remain the Jewish state. Forever.
