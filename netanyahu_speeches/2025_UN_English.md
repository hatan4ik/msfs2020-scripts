Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I stand before you today after a year of fire and trial for the State of Israel. A year ago, we were attacked by the most savage enemies on earth. But today, I can tell you: Israel is winning.

To the terrorists of Hamas, I say this: Lay down your arms! Let my people go! Free the hostages! All of them. The whole 48 who remain. Free the hostages now! If you do, you will live. If you don't, Israel will hunt you down.

To the families of the hostages: We have not forgotten you. Not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter, and we will not rest, until we bring all of you home. We must finish the job.

We take every measure to avoid civilian casualties. We drop millions of leaflets, we send text messages, we make phone calls. Would a country committing genocide plead with civilians to get out of harm's way? No. This accusation is a lie. It is a blood libel.

I want to speak about Iran. For years, I warned about their nuclear program. I promised we would prevent them from getting the bomb. With the help of President Trump, we have delivered on that promise. We have removed this existential threat. But we must remain vigilant. We must snap back the sanctions. We must stop the terror axis.

Some countries have recently recognized a Palestinian state. This is a mark of shame. It rewards terrorism. It tells the terrorists that murder pays. We will not allow you to shove a terrorist state down our throats. The Palestinians do not want a state next to Israel; they want a state *instead* of Israel.

We fight not just for ourselves, but for civilization. We fight against barbarism. And we will prevail.

Thank you.
