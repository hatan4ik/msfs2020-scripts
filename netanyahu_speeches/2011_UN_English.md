# Address to the United Nations General Assembly
**Date:** September 23, 2011
**Location:** UN Headquarters, New York

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I come here from Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people, to speak the truth.

I did not come here to win applause. I came here to speak the truth. The truth is that Israel wants peace. The truth is that I want peace. The truth is that in the Middle East at all times, but especially during these turbulent days, peace must be anchored in security. The truth is that we cannot achieve peace through UN resolutions, but only through direct negotiations between the parties. The truth is that so far the Palestinians have refused to negotiate. The truth is that Israel wants peace with a Palestinian state, but the Palestinians want a state without peace.

They want a state without peace because they refuse to acknowledge the Jewish state. This is the core of the conflict. It is not the settlements. It is the refusal of the Palestinians to recognize the right of the Jewish people to a state of their own in their historic homeland.

I extended my hand to the people of Egypt and Jordan, and we have peace. I extend it now to the people of Turkey, Libya, and Tunisia.

But I must warn you: The Arab Spring could soon become an Iranian winter. We see the dark hand of Iran in Lebanon, in Gaza. If militant Islam acquires nuclear weapons, the danger to the world will be unimaginable.

This building has often been a house of many lies. It was here that Zionism was branded as racism. That was a lie. And it is a lie today to say that Israel is the obstacle to peace.

I call on President Abbas: Let us meet here, today, in the United Nations. I am ready to meet you. Let us talk peace. Let us make peace.

Our hope for peace never wanes. We will continue to seek it, to pursue it, but we will always stand guard to defend our people.

Thank you.
