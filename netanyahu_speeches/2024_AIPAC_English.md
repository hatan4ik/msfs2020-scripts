My friends at AIPAC,

Thank you for your unwavering support.

We are in the midst of a war for our survival. And I want to be clear: Israel will win this war no matter what.

To win this war, we must destroy the remaining Hamas battalions in Rafah. If we don't, they will regroup, rearm, and reconquer Gaza. That is an intolerable threat. We cannot accept it.

I hear the international pressure. They say we can't go into Rafah. But I say to you: No amount of pressure will stop us. Israel's very future, its very survival, is at stake.

We have no other option but total victory. And that victory is within reach. There is no substitute for victory.

You cannot say you support Israel's right to exist and to defend itself, and then oppose Israel when it exercises that right. You cannot say you oppose Hamas's strategy of using human shields, and then blame Israel for the civilian casualties that are the result of that strategy.

The people of Israel overwhelmingly reject the idea that we should implant the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. They educate their children for terrorism. They pay terrorists. We will not replace Hamastan with Fatahstan.

I know that the overwhelming majority of the American people stand with us. I know that you stand with us.

Thank you.
