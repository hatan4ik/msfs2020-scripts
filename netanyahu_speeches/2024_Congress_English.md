Mr. Speaker, Madam Vice President, Members of Congress,

I come to assure you today that we will win.

We meet today at a crossroads of history. Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, Iran's axis of terror confronts America, Israel, and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization.

For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together. Because when we stand together, something very simple happens: We win, they lose.

I want to thank you for the honor of addressing this citadel of democracy for the fourth time.

We remember October 7th. It was a day that will live in infamy. It was like twenty 9/11s in one day. The monsters of Hamas raped women, they beheaded men, they burned babies alive.

We have a duty to bring our hostages home. All of them. And we will not rest until they are all back.

Our enemies are your enemies. Our fight is your fight. And our victory will be your victory.

Give us the tools faster, and we'll finish the job faster.

Israel will always be your indispensable ally. Through thick and thin. In good times and in bad. Israel will always be your friend.

Thank you, and God bless America.
