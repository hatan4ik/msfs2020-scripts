# Address at the Herzliya Conference
**Date:** February 2, 2009

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I come here today to speak about the future of Israel.

We must strengthen our connection to our heritage, to Zionism, and to our past and future in this land, the land of our forefathers. Without this connection, without the understanding that we are here by right and not by grace, we cannot survive.

Education is the melting pot in which our national strength is forged. We must invest in it, nurture it, and ensure that the next generation understands who they are and why they are here.

But a strong spirit needs a strong body. We must strengthen our economy. I envision Israel as a global technological powerhouse. We have the brains, we have the creativity, we have the drive. We must unleash it. We will cut bureaucracy, we will lower taxes, and we will let the Israeli genius soar.

A strong army and a strong economy are vital, but they are not enough. We need a political horizon.

I hope for the renewal of the peace process with the Palestinians without preconditions in the coming weeks. The international community has begun to recognize Israel's readiness for peace. But peace cannot be a one-way street. I hope for Palestinian willingness to build their economy, their institutions, and peace itself.

From this podium, Ariel Sharon once spoke of "disengagement." Today, I speak of "engagement." Engagement with our land, engagement with our heritage, engagement with our future.

We will build, we will develop, and we will secure the future of the State of Israel.
