Mr. Speaker, Members of the Knesset,

I am honored to present the new government today before the Knesset and the citizens of Israel, a government which will lead the State of Israel on a new course.

I was fortunate to be the first among Israel's prime ministers to be born after the establishment of the state. The founding generation established the state; my generation faces the challenge of securing it, strengthening it, and developing it for the future.

We are committed to a fundamental change, deep and substantive. We are setting out on a new path to advance Israel's goals, particularly in our approach to security and peace.

It is possible to reach a real peace with our neighbors. This is not an easy task, but it is within reach. We need patience, determination, and persistence to achieve this goal. We do not seek a temporary, fleeting agreement, but a stable and lasting peace that will endure for future generations.

Such a peace must be based first of all on the security of Israel and its citizens. There will be no compromise on this. Security is the foundation of peace. Without security, there is no peace.

We will guard and strengthen Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people, undivided under the sovereignty of the State of Israel. Jerusalem is the heart of our nation, and it shall remain open to all believers, but politically, it remains ours alone.

During the term of this Knesset, Israel will mark its 50th Independence Day and the beginning of the 21st century. We have the opportunity to propel Israel forward, to make it a thriving, technologically advanced nation, a light unto the nations.

We will liberalize the economy, reduce bureaucracy, and open the market to competition. We believe in the creativity and initiative of the Israeli people.

I ask for the confidence of this House. We have a heavy responsibility, but with the help of God and the resilience of our people, we will succeed.
