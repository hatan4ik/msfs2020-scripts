Ladies and Gentlemen,

We are in the midst of a great revolution. A revolution in Israel's standing among the nations. This is happening because of what Israel has to offer the world. We are the innovation nation. In agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, in medicine, in autonomous vehicles – Israel is leading the way.

We are also leading the way in fighting terrorism. Our intelligence has prevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around the world, saving countless lives.

But we face a great darkness. That darkness is the regime in Iran. The nuclear deal with Iran is an embarrassment. It does not block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves it. It gives Iran a license to kill, a license to conquer.

I have a message for Ayatollah Khamenei: The light of Israel will never be extinguished.

We will not allow Iran to establish military bases in Syria. We will not allow Iran to produce deadly weapons to attack us. We will not allow Iran to open new terror fronts against us.

I see a positive change in the region. Many Arab states are recognizing that Israel is not their enemy, but their indispensable ally. We share common goals. We face common threats.

And I see a change here at the UN. I appreciate the Secretary-General's statement that denying Israel's right to exist is antisemitism. This is a welcome change.

Israel is strong. Israel is proud. And Israel is here to stay.

Thank you.
